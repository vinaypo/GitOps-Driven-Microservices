# Project Introduction



# Intro to Online Boutique App



This is a type of e-commerce platform, but unlike Amazon-type stores, it focuses on:



- **Niche or curated products**

- **Unique / limited collections**

- **Strong brand identity & style**



Think of it as a **digital version of a small, stylish fashion store**.



But from a **technical perspective**, modern boutique apps are **not built as a single application**.



They are built using **Microservices Architecture**.



> [!TIP]

># What is Microservices?

>

>**Microservices** is an architectural style where an application is broken into **small, independent services**, and each service:

>

>- Handles a **specific business function**

>- Runs independently

>- Communicates via APIs

>

>👉 Instead of one big application (monolith), you have **multiple small services working together**.

>

>---

>

># Online Boutique = Microservices in Action

>

>This online boutique app is made up of multiple services like:

>

>### 🧾 Product Catalog Service

>

>- Manages product list, categories, pricing

>

>### 🛒 Cart Service

>

>- Handles user cart (add/remove items)

>

>### 💳 Payment Service

>

>- Processes payments (UPI, cards)

>

>### 📦 Order Service

>

>- Manages order lifecycle

>

>### 👤 Frontend Service

>

>- Authentication & profiles

>

>### 🚚 Shipping Service

>

>- Delivery tracking & logistics

>

>### Etc..

>

>---

>

># How These Services Communicate

>

>- REST APIs (HTTP)

>- gRPC (faster internal communication)

>- Message queues (Kafka / RabbitMQ)

>

>👉 Example:

>

>- Cart service → calls Product service

>- Order service → calls Payment service

>

>---

>

># Monolith vs Microservices

>

>### Monolithic App ❌

>

>- Everything in one codebase

>- Hard to scale

>- Single failure affects whole system

>

>### Microservices App ✅

>

>- Independent services

>- Easy to scale

>- Fault isolation

>

>👉 That's why modern apps (like boutique apps) use microservices.




# **Architecture**



**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different languages that talk to each other over gRPC.



![Architecture01](images/Architecture01.png)



| **Service** | **Language** | **Description** |

| --- | --- | --- |

| [frontend](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/frontend) | Go | Exposes an HTTP server to serve the website. Handles user sessions and displays product catalog. |

| [cartservice](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/cartservice) | C# | Stores the items in the user's shopping cart in Redis. Manages add/remove/view cart operations. |

| [productcatalogservice](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/productcatalogservice) | Go | Provides the list of products from a JSON file. Returns product details, pricing, and inventory. |

| [currencyservice](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/currencyservice) | Node.js | Converts one money amount to another currency. Provides real-time exchange rate conversions. |

| [paymentservice](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/paymentservice) | Node.js | Charges the given credit card info (mock implementation). Simulates payment processing without real transactions. |

| [shippingservice](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/shippingservice) | Go | Gives shipping cost estimates based on shopping cart contents and destination. Calculates delivery logistics. |

| [emailservice](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/emailservice) | Python | Sends users an order confirmation email (mock implementation). Logs email delivery attempts. |

| [checkoutservice](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/checkoutservice) | Go | Retrieves user cart, prepares order and orchestrates payment, shipping and notification services. |

| [recommendationservice](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/recommendationservice) | Python | Recommends other products based on user browsing and shopping history. Provides personalized suggestions. |

| [adservice](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/adservice) | Java | Provides text ads based on given context words. Returns relevant advertisements for product pages. |

| [loadgenerator](https://github.com/vinaypo/GitOps-Driven-Microservices/tree/main/src/loadgenerator) | Python/Locust | Continuously sends requests imitating realistic user behavior. Generates synthetic traffic for testing. |

**Most services are stateless**, and **only the cart uses persistence (Redis)**. Let's break it down cleanly.



# How data works in `microservices-demo`



This project is **designed** to:



- Demonstrate **microservice communication**

- Be **easy to deploy anywhere**

- Avoid complex database ops



So it uses **minimal persistence** on purpose.



---



## Service-by-Service Data Breakdown



### ✅ **cartservice** → ✔️ HAS persistence



**Storage used:**



- **Redis**



**What's stored:**



- User cart items

- Quantity, product IDs



**Why Redis?**



- Fast

- Simple

- Easy to reset

- No schema complexity



📌 In Kubernetes:



- Redis runs as a pod (or StatefulSet)

- Cart data is lost if Redis is deleted (by default)



---



### ❌ **orders / checkout** → NO real database



There is **NO dedicated "orders database"**.



**checkoutservice:**



- Aggregates data from:

    - cartservice

    - paymentservice

    - shippingservice

    - emailservice

- Simulates order placement

- Does **not persist orders**



👉 This is **by design**, to keep the demo lightweight.



---



### ❌ **productcatalogservice**



**Storage:**



- Static JSON file

- Loaded into memory at startup



**No DB**



- Products reset on restart



---



### ❌ **recommendationservice**



**Storage:**



- Stateless

- Generates recommendations dynamically



---



### ❌ **paymentservice**



**Storage:**



- None

- Fake payment processor



---



### ❌ **shippingservice**



**Storage:**



- None

- Simulated shipping cost logic



---



### ❌ **emailservice**



**Storage:**



- None

- Just logs "email sent"



---



### ❌ **adservice**



**Storage:**



- In-memory ad data

- No persistence



---



### ❌ **frontend**



**Storage:**



- Stateless

- Just UI + API calls



---



### ❌ **currencyservice**



**Storage:**



- Static exchange rates

- In-memory only
