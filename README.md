\# Project Introduction



\# Intro to Online Boutique App



This is a type of e-commerce platform, but unlike Amazon-type stores, it focuses on:



\- \*\*Niche or curated products\*\*

\- \*\*Unique / limited collections\*\*

\- \*\*Strong brand identity \& style\*\*



Think of it as a \*\*digital version of a small, stylish fashion store\*\*.



But from a \*\*technical perspective\*\*, modern boutique apps are \*\*not built as a single application\*\*.



They are built using \*\*Microservices Architecture\*\*.



> \[!TIP]

># What is Microservices?

>

>\*\*Microservices\*\* is an architectural style where an application is broken into \*\*small, independent services\*\*, and each service:

>

>- Handles a \*\*specific business function\*\*

>- Runs independently

>- Communicates via APIs

>

>👉 Instead of one big application (monolith), you have \*\*multiple small services working together\*\*.

>

>---

>

># Online Boutique = Microservices in Action

>

>This online boutique app is made up of multiple services like:

>

>### 🧾 Product Catalog Service

>

>- Manages product list, categories, pricing

>

>### 🛒 Cart Service

>

>- Handles user cart (add/remove items)

>

>### 💳 Payment Service

>

>- Processes payments (UPI, cards)

>

>### 📦 Order Service

>

>- Manages order lifecycle

>

>### 👤 Frontend Service

>

>- Authentication \& profiles

>

>### 🚚 Shipping Service

>

>- Delivery tracking \& logistics

>

>### Etc..

>

>---

>

># How These Services Communicate

>

>- REST APIs (HTTP)

>- gRPC (faster internal communication)

>- Message queues (Kafka / RabbitMQ)

>

>👉 Example:

>

>- Cart service → calls Product service

>- Order service → calls Payment service

>

>---

>

># Monolith vs Microservices

>

>### Monolithic App ❌

>

>- Everything in one codebase

>- Hard to scale

>- Single failure affects whole system

>

>### Microservices App ✅

>

>- Independent services

>- Easy to scale

>- Fault isolation

>

>👉 That’s why modern apps (like boutique apps) >use microservices.





\# \*\*Architecture\*\*



\*\*Online Boutique\*\* is composed of 11 microservices written in different languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

| \*\*Service\*\* | \*\*Language\*\* | \*\*Description\*\* |

| --- | --- | --- |

| \[frontend](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/frontend) | Go | Exposes an HTTP server to serve the website. Does not require signup/login and generates session IDs for all users automatically. |

| \[cartservice](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/cartservice) | C# | Stores the items in the user's shopping cart in Redis and retrieves it. |

| \[productcatalogservice](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/productcatalogservice) | Go | Provides the list of products from a JSON file and ability to search products and get individual products. |

| \[currencyservice](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/currencyservice) | Node.js | Converts one money amount to another currency. Uses real values fetched from European Central Bank. It's the highest QPS service. |

| \[paymentservice](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/paymentservice) | Node.js | Charges the given credit card info (mock) with the given amount and returns a transaction ID. |

| \[shippingservice](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/shippingservice) | Go | Gives shipping cost estimates based on the shopping cart. Ships items to the given address (mock) |

| \[emailservice](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/emailservice) | Python | Sends users an order confirmation email (mock). |

| \[checkoutservice](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/checkoutservice) | Go | Retrieves user cart, prepares order and orchestrates the payment, shipping and the email notification. |

| \[recommendationservice](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/recommendationservice) | Python | Recommends other products based on what's given in the cart. |

| \[adservice](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/adservice) | Java | Provides text ads based on given context words. |

| \[loadgenerator](https://github.com/laxmikantagiri/Production-Grade\_GitOps-Driven\_Microservices-Demo/blob/main/src/loadgenerator) | Python/Locust | Continuously sends requests imitating realistic user shopping flows to the frontend. |

\*\*Most services are stateless\*\*, and \*\*only the cart uses persistence (Redis)\*\*. Let’s break it down cleanly.



\# How data works in `microservices-demo`



This project is \*\*designed\*\* to:



\- Demonstrate \*\*microservice communication\*\*

\- Be \*\*easy to deploy anywhere\*\*

\- Avoid complex database ops



So it uses \*\*minimal persistence\*\* on purpose.



\---



\## Service-by-Service Data Breakdown



\### ✅ \*\*cartservice\*\* → ✔️ HAS persistence



\*\*Storage used:\*\*



\- \*\*Redis\*\*



\*\*What’s stored:\*\*



\- User cart items

\- Quantity, product IDs



\*\*Why Redis?\*\*



\- Fast

\- Simple

\- Easy to reset

\- No schema complexity



📌 In Kubernetes:



\- Redis runs as a pod (or StatefulSet)

\- Cart data is lost if Redis is deleted (by default)



\---



\### ❌ \*\*orders / checkout\*\* → NO real database



There is \*\*NO dedicated “orders database”\*\*.



\*\*checkoutservice:\*\*



\- Aggregates data from:

&#x20;   - cartservice

&#x20;   - paymentservice

&#x20;   - shippingservice

&#x20;   - emailservice

\- Simulates order placement

\- Does \*\*not persist orders\*\*



👉 This is \*\*by design\*\*, to keep the demo lightweight.



\---



\### ❌ \*\*productcatalogservice\*\*



\*\*Storage:\*\*



\- Static JSON file

\- Loaded into memory at startup



\*\*No DB\*\*



\- Products reset on restart



\---



\### ❌ \*\*recommendationservice\*\*



\*\*Storage:\*\*



\- Stateless

\- Generates recommendations dynamically



\---



\### ❌ \*\*paymentservice\*\*



\*\*Storage:\*\*



\- None

\- Fake payment processor



\---



\### ❌ \*\*shippingservice\*\*



\*\*Storage:\*\*



\- None

\- Simulated shipping cost logic



\---



\### ❌ \*\*emailservice\*\*



\*\*Storage:\*\*



\- None

\- Just logs “email sent”



\---



\### ❌ \*\*adservice\*\*



\*\*Storage:\*\*



\- In-memory ad data

\- No persistence



\---



\### ❌ \*\*frontend\*\*



\*\*Storage:\*\*



\- Stateless

\- Just UI + API calls



\---



\### ❌ \*\*currencyservice\*\*



\*\*Storage:\*\*



\- Static exchange rates

\- In-memory only



\---

> “The demo intentionally keeps most services stateless to simplify deployment and focus on platform concerns like CI/CD, observability, scaling, and networking.”
